## Analytical Components

### Descriptive Statistics

* Frequency distributions and summary measures
* Bar graphs for categorical data visualization

### Relationship Analysis

* Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables
* Visual assessment of trends and associations

### Preliminary Testing

* Initial tests conducted to assess data characteristics
* Results used to guide the choice of statistical methods

### Inferential Analysis

* Application of non-parametric statistical tests
* Methods selected to address non-normality and scale limitations common in survey data
